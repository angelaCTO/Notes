**Driving Business Value with Design Thinking**  
---

**Description:**
  - Design Thinking is a human-centered approach to innovations that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements of business success.

**Abstract:**
  - The word “design” has traditionally been used to describe the visual aesthetics of objects such as books, websites, products, architecture, and fashion. Yet increasingly design as discipline is expanding to include not just the shaping of artifacts but also the ways people interact with systems, services, and organizations.  
  - As the challenges and opportunities facing society grow more complex, and as stakeholders grow more diverse, an approach known as "design thinking" is playing a greater role in finding meaningful paths forward. Design thinking is an iterative problem solving process of discovery, ideation, and experimentation that employs design-based techniques to gain insight and yield innovative solutions for virtually any type of organizational or business challenge, prominently including those within public service.

  - Demonstrate the Design Thinking process.
  - Think differently about your work  by taking action to apply Design Thinking to value-added work situations.
