#Design Thinking Step-By-Step  
---
  **1. Oberve**  
    - View people and their behavior in the context of their lives or their work. 
    - Try waching what your users do.
    - Observing how they interact with their enviroment provides insights into their feelings and needs.      
  
  
  **2. Engage**  
    - Interact with and interview with users to understand their challenges.      
  
  
  **3. Immerse**  
    - Experience what your users experience as much as possible. 
    - Discover what it's like to do what they do, see what they see. The more variety of expereinces the better.   


## **The Five Phases of the Design Thinking Process**  
---  

*Questions are built around goals.*  

The Design-Thinking Process is centered around the following mindsets:  

  **1. Focus On Human Values**  
  **2. Craft Clarity**  
  **3. Bias Towards Action**  
  **4. Mindful Process**  
  **5. Embracing Experimentation**  
  **6. Radical Collaboration**  
  **7. Show, Don't Tell**  
  **8. Craft Clarity**  

The Design-Thinking Process Follows The Five Following Phases:  
  **1. Emphathize**  
    - *Empathy is the foundation of Design-Thinking* 
    - You need to understand the people you are designing for in order to better understand their situation.  
    - **ASK** - *How do we approach it?*  
    - **DO** - *Empathize with your users to lear about their needs and problems.*  
        **1. Observe**   
          + View people and their behavior in the context pf their lives of their work.    
          + Try watching what your users do.    
          + Observing how they interact with their enviroment provides insights into their feelings and needs.  
        **2. Engage** 
          + Interact with and interview users to understand their challenges.    
        **3. Immerse**
          + Experience what your users experience as much as possible.    
          + Discover what it's like to do what they do, see what they see.  
          + The more variety of experiences the better.
    
  **2. Define**
    - *Focus and frame the problem statement.*
    - Define opportunities from the user's point of view based on what you've learned in the Emphathize phase. 
    - The output of this statement is a problem statement.  
    - **ASK** - How do we interpret it?  
    - **DO** - Define to synthesize your findings.  
      - **1. Identity**  
        - Identify compelling needs and insights.  
        - At the same time, search for meaningful patterns.  
      - **2. Scope**  
        - Out of gathering the information and insights you've gathered and the patterns and themes that emerged, scope out a specific and meaningful challenge
        - This will be a shared point of view.
      
  **3. Ideate**  
    -  *We see an opportunity.*  
    -  Focus on generating a broad diverse range of solutions for addressing the challenges identifed in the Define Phase.   
    -  **ASK** - What do we create?  
    -  **DO** - Colectively brainstorm to explore a wide array of possible solutions  
  
  **4. Prototype**
    - *Build to think and collaborate*    
    - Take the best ideas and make them cheap and tangible by creating quick cheap prototypes  
    - **ASK** - How do we build it?
    - **DO** - Prototype to make your solution real.
    
  **5. Test**  
  - *Will we meet the user's needs?*  
  - Strengthen what was learned in the Empathize phase by testing with users in the context of their work lives.  
  - **ASK** - Have we adequately addressed the user's key needs from their point of view
  - **DO** - Test to strengthen user empathy and uncover new prototype requirements.
