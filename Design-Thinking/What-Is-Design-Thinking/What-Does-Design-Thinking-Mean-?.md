      -  Use intuition to look for patterns  
  
  
  **3. Define Design Principles**    
      -  Facilitate social interactions at all times
      -  Boost rewards to increase adherence
  
  
  **4. Make Tangible**    
      -  "How might we" questions?  
      -  Turn ideas into prototypes, create mock-ups, tweaking concepts  
  
  
  **5. Iterate Relentlessly**  
      - Learn from past success and failures to develop the best product possible; test for success
