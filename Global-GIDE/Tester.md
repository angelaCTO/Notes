##Testing In Context : **An End-To-End Flow**
**Components of an End-To-End Flow:**
  - User Story
  - Test Approaches
  - Writing good test plans
  - Creating a test plan
  - Managing test cases
  - Executing manual test cases
  - Managing Bugs

**A General Work Flow:**  
  1. Be involved in creating the requirements    
  2. Write inital test cases   
  3. Review with customes  
  4. Work with developers to track updates  
  5. Attend the code review / demo  
  6. Update test cases for specific UI's  
  7. Validate requirements  
  8. Perform exploratory testing  
  9. File / Validate bugs  

##User Stories
**Template: "As a [user] I want [feature] so that [benefit]"**:
Should contain or clearly imply acceptance criteria - *Definition of* ***DONE***  

  **INVEST:**  
  - **I** - Independent
  - **N** - Negotiable
  - **V** - Valuable
  - **E** - Estimatable
  - **S** - Small
  - **T** - Testable

###Requirements != Implementation
  - Requirements and Implementation are not the same.
  - Requirements specify attributes of a system, whether functional or non-functional. 
  - Implementation explains ***how*** the software fulfills the requirement. **It is the realization of a specification.**

###User Story Example: 
**[User] Requirement:** *"Registered Users will be able to purchase music from the Music Store"*  
**Test Approaches:**  
  - *Required Tests:*
    - Static Tests:
      - Code Reviews
    - Dynamic Tests:
      - Functional Testing  
      - Regression Testing  
      - Integration  
      - Security  
  - *Extraneous Tests (ie. time permitting):*
    - Performance  
    - Usability  
    - Compatibility
