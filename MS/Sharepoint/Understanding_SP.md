###Sharepoint App Model :: The Change From SharePoint Solutions Development

---

  - **What was wrong with SharePoint Solutions?** 
    - **Instability** : Custom code written by developers run within SP's host enviroment. This reduces reduced stability of MS SP. Eliminating any type of custom code that run within SP enviroment results in lower risks, fewer problems, and greater stability for the hosting farm. 
      - ***Custom code running inside the SharePoint host environment poses risks and compromises scalability.***
        - *w3wp.exe* : Main SP worker process (managed code deployed in a farm solution runs here)
        - *SPUCWorkerProcess.exe* : SP sandboxed worker process (managed code deployed using a sandbox solution runs here)
    - **Difficult To Upgrade Solutions** : SharePoint solutions are often developed with full trust and perform complex operations. These solutions are often tightly bound to a particular feature set, which means that they might not move gracefully to the next version of SharePoint. 
      - ***Custom code with dependencies on in-process DLLs causes problems when migrating from one version of SharePoint to the next.***
    - **Security Concerns** : The root problem is that code always runs under the identity and with the permissions of a specific user. There is a security issue in that a SharePoint solution with a feature receiver is able to execute code that can do anything that the site administrator can do. There really isnâ€™t a practical way to constrain the SharePoint solution code so that it runs with a lesser set of permissions than the user that has activated the feature. 
      - ***A permissions model for custom code based entirely on the identity of the current user is inflexible.***
    - **Permissions + Deployment Issues** : In a nutshell, the security problems with SharePoint solutions stem from the fact that you cannot effectively configure permissions for a specific SharePoint solution. This limitation cannot be overcome, because the SharePoint solution development model provides no way to establish the identity of SharePoint solution code independent of user identity. Because there is no ability to establish the identity of code from a SharePoint solution, there is no way to configure permissions for it.
      - ***User impersonation solves the too-little-permissions problem but replaces it with the too-many-permissions problem, which is even worse.***
  - ***What's good about SharePoint App?***
    - Following the design flaws of its predecessor, ...
      - Apps must be supported in Office 365 and in on-premises farms
      - App code never runs within the SharePoint host environment.
      - App code programs against SharePoint sites by using web service entry points to minimize version-specific dependencies.
      - App code is authenticated and runs under a distinct identity
      - App permissions can be configured independently of user permissions
      - Apps are deployed by using a publishing scheme based on app catalogs. Apps that are published in a catalog are easier to discover, install, and upgrade


###SharePoint App Model Architecture

---

**SharePoint Farm**
  - A *SharePoint Farm* is a collection of SP servers or SQL servers that work in concert to provide a set of basic SP services to support a single site. 
    - The ability of multiple servers to work in conjunction and provide redundancy is important in the cloud, especially for large data centers. One value of such a system is its failover capabilities - if any server is incapacitated, another one can take over for it. The servers can also provide readily available backups that can scale to immense sizes.
    - Within a farm, there are several services that run on one or more servers. These services provide basic functionality for SharePoint and regulate which services should run on which servers, in an effort to manage the impact on overall farm architecture and performance
      
**SharePoint Tenancy** 
  - A *SharePoint Tenancy* is a set of site collections that are configured and administrated as a unit. When a new customer establishes an Office 365 account to host its SharePoint sites, the Office 365 environment creates a new tenancy
    - *Tenants* - Customer's buisness users who access the tenancy
  - When the Office 365 environment creates a new tenancy for a customer, it creates an administrative site collection which is accessible to users who have been configured to play the role of a *Tenant Administrator*
    -  A tenant administrator can create additional site collections and configure the set of services that are available to all the sites running within the tenancy.
  - The architecture of the SharePoint App Model requires that apps are always installed and run within the context of a specific tenancy. 
    - SharePoint 2013 is able to support installing and running SharePoint apps in on-premises farms by transparently creating a farm-wide tenancy behind the scenes that is known as the *Default Tenancy.*

**App Management Service (AMS)**
  - Responsible for tracking other types of app specific configuration data that deals with app security principles, permissions, and licensing
  - Has own DB used to store config details for apps as they are installed and configured
  - **To Create Instance** : Done via the ***Central Administration*** or by using the ***Farm Creation Wizard*** 

**Site Subscription Setting Service (SSSS)**
   - Responsible for managing tenancies. Each time a new tenancy is created, this service adds configuration data for it in its own DB
   - The Site Subscription Settings Service is particularly important to the SharePoint app model due to the requirement that SharePoint apps must always be installed and run within the context of a specific tenancy.
   - **To Create Instance** : Must be done via the ***Windows Powershell***. When SSSS is created (via powershell), a default tenancy is automatically created which makes it possible to install SP apps in sites throughout the farm

*(Note, if you want to configure support for SP apps in an on-premise farm, you must explicitly create an instance of both AMS and SSSS; else don't worry about creating or configuring either those because they are managed entirely behind the scenes)*

###App Installation Scope

---

**A SP app must be installed before it can be made availble for users. You must install the app within the context of the *target web*. The site from which an app has been launched is known as the *host web***. There are two different scopes "scenarios":

1. **Site Scope** : App is installed and launched within the scope of the same SharePoint site. In this scenario, the host web will always be the same site where the app has been installed.

2. **Tenancy Scope** : App is installed in a special type of SharePoint site known as an ***App Catalog Site***. Once the app has been installed in an app catalog site, the app can then be configured so that users can launch it from other sites. In this scenario, the host web will not be the same site where the app has been installed.
 - The ability to install and configure apps at tenancy scope is especially valuable for scenarios in which a single app is going to be used by many different users across multiple sites within an Office 365 tenancy or an on-premises farm.
 - A single administrative user can configure app permissions and manage licensing in one place, which prevents the need to install and configure the app on a site-by-site basis.
